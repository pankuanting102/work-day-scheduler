# work-day-scheduler
Please find links below for git repository and deployed applications of week 5 homework.
I've used JQuery and moment.js api to construct javascript. In addition to the brief, I've display "Your schedule is saved" message after clicking on save button for imporving user experience. Please let me know if any thoughts and thank you for reviewing!
